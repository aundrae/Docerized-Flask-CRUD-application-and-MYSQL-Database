ASSIGNMENT #1

I collected the flask application from:
https://www.codementor.io/garethdwyer/building-a-crud-application-with-flask-and-sqlalchemy-dm3wv7yu2

I used the mysql documentation to connect the flask application. The link is: 
https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql

To use the application:
1) To create an item enter the name and click the add button.
2) The items under the books header are read from the database.
3) To update an item check enter a new title in the respective input field and click update.
4) To delete an item click the delete button under the respective item.
